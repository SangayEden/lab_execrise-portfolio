        The Student Registration System is a web-based platform designed to streamline the registration process for students and staff. Students can access a dedicated interface to view their personal details, complete registration forms, and securely save their information to the system's database. On the staff side, the system provides an intuitive interface that allows staff members to review student submissions in a tabular format, verify the details, sort data for easy management, and notify students about the status of their registration. The system enhances the efficiency and transparency of the registration process, making it easier for both students and staff to manage and track registration activities.
